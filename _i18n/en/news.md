## MOU ceremony of the OSORI project (Apr. 26, 2023)

### Highlight
Kakao, LG Electronics, and Samsung Electronics have organized OSORI open source project and signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to provide open source software license information for free from October. This is possible through the work of standardizing each company's license information into a database by the Korea Copyright Commission. This information includes the name of the license, version information, and restriction in its usage. It is part of an effort to develop the Korean software industry and reduce the risk of copyright infringement.
