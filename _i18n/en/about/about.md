# About : What is the OSORI project?

## Name
OSORI (Open Source DB Integration) means "Open Source sounds!" It expresses the will to create a better open source ecosystem through voluntary contribution and collaboration.

## Goal
The goal of the OSORI project is to contribute to building a more transparent and reliable open source ecosystem by integrating and disclosing open source information data (e.g. license and any restriction to use), so that anyone can easily check it out.

## Vision
- We build a DB schema that efficiently integrates open source information data, of which is easy to manage and distribute consistently.
- We increase the reliability of the data through cross-validation and disclose it for its complimentary usage by anyone.
- We expand volume of the data through voluntary contributions by providing an environment where anyone can easily contribute their data to the OSORI project,
